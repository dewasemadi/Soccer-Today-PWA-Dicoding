# Soccer-Today-PWA-Dicoding
A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices. While web applications have been available for mobile devices from the start, they have generally been slower, have had fewer features, and have been less used than native apps. PWA features narrow the gap between user experience in web-based and native applications. Features include

Ability to run offline
High performance
Background processing in service workers in a separate thread
Access to the phone's sensors
Support for push notifications
An icon on the phoneâ€˜s home screen
